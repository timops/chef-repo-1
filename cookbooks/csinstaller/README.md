The cookbook sets up the CloudPlatform management server and can setup a Adv. networking VMware-based Zone.
The steps are:

* Host the CloudPlatform Installer from a HTTP server

Host the Installer tarball so that it is accessible over HTTP. Set the following attribute accordingly:
    default['download_url'] = "http://localhost"

* Setup SELinux to be permissive
* Setup ntp with valid NTP servers
* Setup MySQL server with valid attributes/configurations
* Setup the CloudPlatform Management server
* Setup the Adv. Zone

The following role definition sets attributes and the run-list

    {
      "run_list": [
        "recipe[selinux::permissive]",
        "recipe[ntp]",
        "recipe[mysql::server]",
        "recipe[csinstaller::mgmt_server]",
        "recipe[csinstaller::setup_zone]"
      ],

      ...

      "override_attributes": {
